# Project Log

## Phase 1 Setup - Initial Environment Setup

### Date: July 21, 2025

#### Tasks Completed:
- ✅ SSH key setup initiated (4096-bit RSA key generated)
- ✅ Folders created: pi_code, teensy_code, docs
- ✅ Git initialization completed
- ✅ Teensy PlatformIO project structure preserved and copied to teensy_code
- ✅ SSH key-based authentication setup (key copied to Pi successfully)
- ✅ SSH connection tested and working without password
- ✅ Rust installation on Pi (Rust 1.88.0 installed successfully)
- ✅ Cargo project creation in pi_code (km_pi project created and tested)
- ✅ Teensy PlatformIO build test (compiled successfully, 4.21 seconds)
- ✅ Basic "Hello World" validation on both platforms

#### Current Structure:
```
km-box/
├── pi_code/           (for Rust project)
├── teensy_code/       (PlatformIO project for Teensy 4.0)
│   ├── platformio.ini
│   ├── src/main.cpp
│   └── .vscode/
├── docs/
│   ├── project_log.md
│   └── copilot_instructions.md
└── README.md
```

#### Next Steps:
1. Complete SSH key setup by entering password 4512 when prompted
2. Update SSH config to include IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3. Test SSH connection to Pi without password
4. Install Rust on Pi via SSH
5. Create Cargo project in pi_code
6. Test basic compilation on both platforms

#### Notes:
- Old pi_passthrough folder will be cleaned up after VS Code releases file handles
- Teensy project already configured for Arduino framework
- Monitor speed set to 115200 in platformio.ini
- PlatformIO executable found at: ~/.platformio/penv/Scripts/platformio.exe

## Phase 1 Results - ✅ COMPLETED

### Build Test Results:
**Raspberry Pi (Rust):**
- ✅ Rust 1.88.0 installed successfully
- ✅ Cargo project "km_pi" created in ~/km_box_project/km_pi
- ✅ Compilation successful (0.27s)
- ✅ "Hello, world!" output confirmed

**Teensy 4.0 (C++ Arduino):**
- ✅ PlatformIO build successful (4.21 seconds)
- ✅ Memory usage: FLASH 21,500 bytes used, 2,010,116 bytes free
- ✅ Memory usage: RAM2 12,416 bytes used, 511,872 bytes free
- ✅ Ready for upload to hardware

### Environment Validation:
- ✅ SSH key-based authentication working (no password required)
- ✅ VS Code tasks configured for both platforms
- ✅ Build toolchains operational on both targets
- ✅ Project structure established and documented

[Test results will be added after completing setup and running initial tests]
