## UART Communication Test Results - Current Status

### ‚úÖ Success: Pi-to-Teensy Communication Working
- **UART Port**: `/dev/ttyAMA0` confirmed as the working port
- **Baud Rate**: 9600 confirmed working
- **Data Flow**: Pi ‚Üí Teensy working perfectly
- **Commands Received**: `ping`, `led_on`, `led_off`, `status`, `test` all received correctly
- **Data Integrity**: All commands received without corruption

### üìä Technical Details
- **Wiring**: GPIO 14 (TX) and GPIO 15 (RX) on Pi 5 correctly mapped to `/dev/ttyAMA0`
- **Voltage Levels**: 3.3V logic compatible between Pi and Teensy
- **Protocol**: Text-based commands with newline termination working
- **Teensy Reception**: Raw byte debugging shows perfect command reception

### ‚ùå Issue: Teensy-to-Pi Response Not Working
- **Problem**: Teensy not sending responses back to Pi
- **Root Cause**: Still running debug firmware instead of response firmware
- **Evidence**: Teensy monitor shows only raw byte debugging, no response sending

### üîß Next Steps
1. **Upload Response Firmware**: Replace debug firmware with bidirectional response firmware
2. **Test Bidirectional**: Verify Pi can receive Teensy responses  
3. **Complete Protocol**: Implement full command-response cycle
4. **Document Results**: Update project log with final working configuration

### üéØ Current State
- **Phase 2 Progress**: 70% complete (unidirectional working)
- **Hardware**: Verified working
- **Software**: Need to complete firmware update
- **Ready for**: Bidirectional testing once firmware updated
